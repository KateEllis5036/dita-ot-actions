    <title>Adding New Validator Rules</title>
    <body>
        <p>
           This DITA-OT plug-in contains a common ruleset of general validator rules. The
           ruleset has been designed to be applicable to all documents created by all
           users. To add new custom rules (which only apply to your specific use case) you
           should create a separate custom validator plug-in which extends the base
           validator. See the sample <xref
        href="https://github.com/jason-fox/com.here.validate.svrl.overrides"
        format="html"
        scope="external"
      >Extended DITA Validator</xref> as an example of
           how to do this.
