            <title>A Tragic Beginning</title>
            <p>A woman with a young daughter fell sick and when the woman knew she was near the end
                of her life, she called for her daughter one last time. The mother told her daughter
                    <q>Dear child, be pious and good, and God will always take care of you, and I
                    will look down upon you from heaven, and will be with you</q>. The mother passed
                away, and her poor daughter wept over her mothers grave every day, and was always
                pious and good.</p>
